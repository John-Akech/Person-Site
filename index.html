     <!-- ABOUT ME --> 
     <main class="profile...">
      <p>As a software engineering student at the African Leadership University (ALU), I am passionate about using technology for positive change in Africa. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in software engineering, where I am developing my skills in software development, data analysis, and innovation.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining ALU, I worked as a caregiver at the Early Childhood Development supported by Plan International, where I fostered the well-being of young children by creating a positive and stimulating environment for their learning and social development. I also enhanced the financial literacy of community members as a trainer at the Refugee Settlement supported by Finnish Refugee Council, empowering them to manage their finances responsibly and achieve financial self-sufficiency. Through these experiences, I have honed my skills in community building, public facilitation, and problem-solving. I have also demonstrated my work ethic and leadership potential, as evidenced by my selection as a participant of the Aspire Leaders Program and the ALX AiCE Program, two prestigious leadership and innovation programs. I am eager to connect and collaborate with other professionals and organizations in the dynamic world of technology and social impact.</p>
